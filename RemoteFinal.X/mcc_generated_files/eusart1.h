  @File Name
    eusart1.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the EUSART1 driver using Foundation Services Library

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for EUSART1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  Foundation Services Library - 0.1.23
        Device            :  PIC18F25K22
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.40
